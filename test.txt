More About
Dr.G.Viswanathan - Chancellor
Dr. G.V, the founder-chancellor of VIT University, was born on December 8, 1938 in a remote village near Vellore in Tamil Nadu. Dr. GV’s life is a source of inspiration to the aspiring youth.
Dr. G.V − The Student
Dr. GV completed Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 2003, nearly four decades after his University education, reaffirming his fervour in being an eternal student. He excelled in academics right from his childhood. His early education was confined to his small village where he studied in Tamil - his mother tongue. His pre-university education at Voorhees College, Vellore initiated him to the world outside. From there he moved on to obtain his Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Economics from the prestigious Loyola College, Chennai. Following this, he graduated in Law from Madras Law College.
Dr. G.V − The Leader of the People
A student leader in his twenties entering Indian parliament was something incredible, especially in 1960s. But it was Dr. GV who championed people’s issues in the parliament and they, in turn, reposed faith in the leader who fulfilled their expectations. They re-elected him by a bigger margin in the next election for another five-year term. He travelled to different parts of the world as a member of parliamentary delegations and appreciated issues in a global perspective. Dr. GV wanted to play a bigger role in the provincial politics in order to make a direct contribution in bettering the lives of the people in the region. He was elected to Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly for ten years. During this period, he served as a Minister for two years.
Dr. G.V − The Educator
Dr. G. Viswanathan founded Vellore Engineering College in 1984 at Vellore. He envisioned that this Institution would offer World-Class Education to students who would in turn create an indelible impact on the society. The engineering college that started with an intake of 180 students in 1984 has evolved as a university with four campuses. Over 25,000 students are enrolled in 51 undergraduate and 33 Postgraduate, 11 Integrated, 2 Research programmes and 2 M.Tech Industrial Programmes with nearly 16,000 residing on the campus. It attracts students and professors from different parts of the world. It houses more than 1000 international students on campus. For the past two years, VIT University has been ranked #1 private engineering institution in India. ISO Certification from Holland, International accreditation from the United Kingdom and USA, and the highest accreditation grade from the Government of India reflect the University’s penchant for excellence on all fronts.
Dr. G.V − The Institution
Due to his passion for societal development and compassion for the underprivileged, Dr. GV has launched several schemes for uplifting the women and unemployed youth in the region to help them become self-reliant. He offers scholarships to students from disadvantaged sections of the society to enable them to pursue higher education. He has established the Universal Higher Education Trust to create opportunities for higher education to every deserving student in the region. He has adopted several villages with the motto of improving the quality of lives of the rural people. His vision of transforming Vellore into a greener and cooler town by planting one million saplings has begun to yield fruit. Dr.GV’s farsightedness extends beyond horizons.

DR. G V SELVAM VICE - PRESIDENT
===============================
Dr. G V Selvam has been associated with the institution since 1999, when he first assumed office as Vice-Chairman of Vellore Engineering College.

He holds a postgraduate degree in Business Administration from University of Madras. Dr. Selvam became the first Vice-President of VIT Chennai in 2010, where he sculptured the campus from the scratch. The high rise structures, the lush green ambience and the ultra-modern infrastructure that adorn VIT Chennai were created within a short span of time under his able leadership. He has developed VIT Chennai campus in conformity with the standards of the Green LEED certification. As the Vice President, he continues to contribute diligently to its growth. His painstaking efforts in implementing several innovative measures have enabled VIT to emerge as an institution of international eminence. A self-motivated and industrious person, and a farsighted educationalist, Dr. G.V. Selvam possesses an innate ability to spot and nurture talent–be it with the faculty, staff or students. He offers flexible and pragmatic academic solutions not only for toppers but also for slow learners.

The lush green, self-sustaining, VIT campuses in Vellore and Chennai are examples of his efforts to adorn the spaces with natural beauty. He is the brain behind the Green Vellore Project, which has added green cover to the rocky and barren landscape of Vellore, and the Clean Palar Project, which is taking measures to restore the Palar river bed to its original texture. He is passionate about transforming Vellore into a clean, green and nature-rich city. Dr. Selvam is inspired and guided by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam’s principle: “A leader must have vision and passion, and not be afraid of any problem. Instead, he should know how to defeat it. Most importantly, he must work with integrity.”

HAT – EXHIBITION 2022
As part of our Institutional distinctiveness one of the best practices we follow in our school is Societal engagement towards sustainable development.
To achieve this we are trying lately in our school to have a public discourse of architecture students work not only in classrooms but also in hall ways, corridors, studios. We believe the best and novel way to disseminate the ideas and talents of young minds is to organize an exhibition which would be a wonderful and interesting platform to meet and interact with people especially - industry experts. Practitioners, connecting with alumni etc , we strongly believe that it will pour an extra enthusiasm and create an awareness of current work practices in industries towards sustainable development and expose the students to real world experience.
In this HAT 2022 Exhibition we have largely organized our work focusing on 3 architecture themes Heritage, Art and Architecture and Technology.
Students of our school get involved in Heritage connect as part of our community engagement and we also made a conscious attempt to incorporate this event as part of our curricula to amplify the voice on behalf of threatened heritage places in Vellore and traditions. Vellore heritage connect event - started in 2018 and students have been taken to various sites in and around Vellore and few of these sites are documented where today you will be exploring some sample works in this central atrium spaces.
The next theme is ART as we believe Art and Architecture have deeper connection and it an integral part of our program curriculum: Every year we conduct Art Festival which is an annual event organized by our school where it brings together artists from across the country to Vellore to promote the interest in art forms among students, teachers and general public at large we organize workshops which encompass several genres including ceramics, sculpture, print making, water colour, oil painting Glimpses of samples are displayed here.
Final theme focuses on ART AND TECHNOLOGYOur school is blessed to be within a vast technological resource that has a high standing as an academic institution at the national and global level. Apart from academic works we can come across works where Students participating in National and International competitions which are creative and cognitive production of the design process and the proposals are so unique and thus increases in efficiency and competitiveness among students.This premier event brings together all students, academicians and practitioners and provides an opportunity for everyone to review and appreciate of our graduate students work in an atmosphere of celebration.
BAMBOO WORKSHOP
Bamboo one of the most versatile materials which finds use in multiple areas of built form. The workshop was organised especially for the second semester students to educate and experience the material. The workshop was held from 03-06 May 2022 at MG Block’s Construction yard. The initial sessions were about understanding the material and its properties. The students made multiple scaled models using bamboo skewers. These models explore various possible built forms in bamboo and two options were selected which would be built in the construction yard. The design and built exercise gave students an opportunity to explore different tools such as power drill, bamboo splitter, sawing to name a few. The workshop was an important learning experience to the students wherein the lessons learnt in classrooms were implemented.

Eventually, selected papers will be submitted to SCOPUS indexed publications namely, ACI Material Journal and Disaster Advances and Springer’s Proceedings for consideration for publication.
ICON2019 PRE CONFERENCE WORKSHOP
It is well known that the microstructure of concrete has a significant role in influencing its properties include strength and durability due to the effect of various parameters like porosity, permeability, and pore size distribution. To achieve high strength and good durability properties, to prevent concrete deterioration, to reduce the capillary porosity and to accomplish a substantial reduction in the total porosity, a need to reduce the gel porosity is required. This leads to a change in the C-S-H structure from porous to more crystalline phase, i.e., change in concrete micro-structure. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of how the performance of concrete is impacted by its microstructure is of prime significance. This workshop aims to provide a platform to impart knowledge on the microstructure of concrete and its influence on the behavior of concrete.
MAKE-A-THON
A technical Design Context namely ICON2019 - Make-A-Thon was organised by Dr. A. Sofi, Associate Professor & HOD, Dr. T. Meena, Associate Professor, and Dr. J. Jayaprakash, Professor, School of Civil Engineering, VIT. This event was held on 10th August 2019 at Foodys, VIT, Vellore. A total of 96 students from both UG and PG programmes of School of Civil Engineering, participated in the make-a-thon event. The students of 16 groups exhibited their creativity in five different themes that includes Earthquake Engineering, Building Stability on slope, Bridges, and Tall Structures to them. The best design model was awarded with a cash prize of INR 6000.

I am a proud alumnus of VIT Vellore campus. I Completed my postgraduate course "M.E - Computer Science and Engineering" in the year 2001.
VIT is a place where we can derive a lot of insights into understanding who we are? what are we? and a place where we can set our targets achievable.
As the logo says, "Uzhaipae Uyarvutharum" and it is the place where we have "a Place to learn and a chance to grow".

I graduated from VIT in 2002, with a BE degree in Computer Science Engineering. It was our first time away from home but the college ended up being a home away from home. VIT not only provided us with strong theoretical and practical fundamentals via its extensive curriculum - it also provided us with fantastic placement support which eventually helped me crack my first job with Accenture. And there has been no looking back since then. Armed with a VIT degree and Accenture experience under my belt, I was able to further secure an admission in the prestigious Indian School of Business, Hyderabad. I eventually moved into the startup space and graduated to being CEO of an early stage fund. I currently am founder of a company which advises startups - helping them go from idea to execution to fundraise. VIT has been instrumental in setting my career trajectory and it's no surprise seeing my alma mater being part of the top colleges of India. It's a proud feeling to see the college doing so well and to see it adding continuous value to all the batches after us as well. Happy to be a small part of this story.

MR. VIVEK PANDYARAJAN
VIT has always remained very close to my heart for various reasons. VIT was very successful in bringing out our talents and potentials much before we stepped into the real world. Its unbelievable that right after we left VIT, most of us clearly knew what our strengths and weaknesses were. To this date, I am perplexed in how true our projections and learnings were. The vision set by our loving GV sir stands firm and sets a great example on how vision needs to be set and executed. VIT has and will always remain a place that provides a rich platform for students to groom themselves. The management, unlike many other regional institutions, never intruded into the privacy of the students and has let the students decide their lives, careers and futures. That is a great example of leadership.
Our learnings and experiences from VIT days reflect greatly in our daily lives. A few days ago I was congratulated for having pulled off a major event management activity. The company was very surprised how I was able to pull off such an event in India, considering I had never worked in India before. The reason is, I had pulled off such events at VIT 20 years ago!
It is remarkable that VIT reaches out to Alumni so often. Even in the US, VIT leadership was very active in socializing with students and alumni. During my days as the Secretary of the VIT alumni association, we were constantly challenged to bring out our best. GV sir's personal interest to learn about every student's life is astonishing. Few weeks ago, we met GV sir at an airport. He spent lot of time patiently listening our professional and personal lives.
It gives great pleasure in seeing VIT students succeed in professional and academic areas globally. VIT students in my organization are performing exceptionally well!
Best wishes to VIT and its management for the years to come.

The Law School aims to impart quality legal education to nourish the young minds with knowledge of law, teach them the nuances of the legal profession and equip them to the nitty gritty of the profession.
VIT School of Law, believes in continuous and active learning simultaneously with practical training. Legal Education is not just mastering of the subject or the varied provisions of the law.

Studying law in VIT is a unique experience as there is a blend of all features of quality education. The course has been structured in such a way that the students can opt to have a specialised knowledge and insight in the particular branch they are interested in along with general knowledge in all other subjects.

In VIT School of Law, Knowledge oriented approach takes the lead over memory based learning and evaluation. The course is designed to encourage the mooting abilities, oratorical skills, interpreting and analysing skills of the budding lawyers by conducting weekly seminars, frequent Moot court trainings, court visits, etc. The syllabus has been framed so as to give importance to theory and practical aspects to meet the rigorous demands set by the legal profession. The evaluation system in VIT also signifies a shift from the contemporary pattern wherein testing of the memory skills is predominant in various Law schools. Problem Based Learning has been embedded in the course and the evaluation of the student will also be on the above said lines. This induces them to analyse the various provision of the law, interpret the case laws and apply them to solve the question of law thereby preparing them for the different facets of the profession.

STARS-SUPPORT THE ADVANCEMENT OF RURAL STUDENTS
"A Child should never be deprived of quality education owing to poverty. This forceful thought in my mind became the seed that gave birth
to the innovative STARS Scheme". – Dr.G.Viswanathan, Chancellor, VIT- Vellore
Philanthropy makes a big difference to people’s lives. On these lines, Our Beloved chancellor Dr.G.Viswanathan has taken several community development initiatives for the betterment of the society, and STARS (Support the Advancement of Rural Students Scheme) is one such philanthropic activity starrted in the year 2008. It aims at enhancing the rural students’ quality of life.
For children in rural villages of Tamilnadu who grow up in difficult circumstances, VIT has become more than a place of academic instruction. It is a home away from home where they feel safe and happy, surrounded by caring Professors/Proctors who not only give them the education and skills to face the future, but also become their emotional pillar.
Since 2008 rural students of Tamilnadu have been admitted through STARS scheme. Each student’s story is an inspiring story of change. Daily wage labourers and domestic helpers find it difficult to educate their children due to their unstable income and difficult living conditions. Their children who are academically brilliant, continue to live their lives in poverty like their families or settle down to basic jobs which satisfies neither their basic needs or their intellectual hunger While many people in our society ignore these hard facts and go ahead with their lives, VIT Management Stands tall as it takes these children in its fold through the STARS scheme (SUPPORT THE ADVANCEMENT OF RURAL STUDENTS). Financially disadvantaged children don’t have to stop dreaming of becoming an Engineer. VIT STARS Scheme helps these students from under privileged background to achieve what they deserve by giving them 100% fee waiver for their academic and hostel facilities including basic medical expenses.
The transition to higher education, which is particularly difficult and expensive for rural youth, requires support. To meet this concept in reality, VIT launched this social innovation as STARS Scheme. Based on their 12th std. marks, one boy and a girl from rural Government Higher Secondary schools in the different districts of Tamil Nadu are chosen under this STARS scheme. Most of the selected meritorious students are first generation graduates from the below poverty line families. The selected Students(STARS) are given admission to a B.Tech course in VIT with 100 percent Scholarship covering free accommodation, food, healthcare and other academic facilities.
VIT stands proud in giving high-quality education to the rural students of Tamil Nadu and provide the doorway for a good career, better social status and most importantly, fine tune them to be responsible citizens.

As I near the end of my third year in college, I am glad I can say that VIT has been more than just the source of a degree. Life away from home was a haunting thought, especially when away from home meant another country on the whole. But, let’s just say that over the years, the surreal sense of VIT being more of a home to me than my hometown itself has taken over me.
The display of an array of talents in the form of club and chapter events in VIT have helped students in exploring their hidden abilities. Dancing for one, was a part of my life that I assumed to be long lost when I left home. So, it was a beautiful experience unfolding a new chapter of dance as I rediscovered classical dance in a new light in the form of MAYA (VIT Dance Club). For a hard-core Bharathanatyam dancer who could only imagine Carnatic music accompanied by mridangam beats, Maya was an eye-opener that made me realize that sky was the limit (having performed Classical dance to the song Counting Stars) when it came to dancing. I was also given the opportunity to participate in various cultural nights and college fests as a result not to forget the inspiring people I’ve met.
On the whole, I’m grateful to VIT for the amazing people it has brought into my life and everything I have learnt in the past three years. Not just engineering, but life lessons too.

Life was not easy at the beginning of my studies in VIT. I was miles away from home, adjusting to a new environment, and had to start over making friends. With time, however, I started adjusting and seeing things differently.
Life became more interesting when I came to know that VIT has numerous opportunities for pursuing your sports interests. Sports have been always a part of my life. I joined the VIT football team right in the first year and then later joined the athletics team as well. This gave me a lot of joy. Now I can proudly say my life in VIT has been great, VIT has made me grow mentally and physically. One thing I love more about VIT is that everything is available and life is very cheap. VIT, I can say, is a great place for studies, the environment is conducive, people are helpful and it gives you a chance to show your talents

“Best of all, VIT has set up a separate Chinese canteen, so we get to eat familiar food.”
When I came to VIT University, it thrilled me to see such a beautiful campus. I have learned a lot here and made many friends. On holidays, the school organizes a wide range of extra-curricular activities. When we encounter difficulties, the International Office always does their best to help us. Being here will certainly enhance my future. At a place for studies, the environment is conducive, people are helpful and it gives you a chance to show your talents.

'So why India and why VIT?'
That's the first question I always face when anyone gets to know that you are a foreigner. The answer differs for everyone. For me, it was just that I wanted to experience studying away from home and this was a good place to start with. The few main things that attracted me to VIT was the academic excellence, infrastructure and Riviera. I actually spent more time watching Riviera videos on YouTube than researching the university!
The academics are great here. Apart from classes, you have good lab facilities, workshops to learn outside class. There are many clubs and chapters as well, be it technical or non-technical, both will keep your hours busy. I am a part of VIT Health Club and was a part of Community radio. I got a chance to register as a member of the dance club for extracurricular activities where I got to learn dance forms from different parts of India which was the best part of all!

My experience at VIT has been top notch. If there is anything to regret it is just that I cannot spend a few more years of my life here.”
When I decided to come to VIT all I knew about Vellore is that there was a big prison. I wondered day and night for over a month if it was the right decision. Here I am now at the end of my third year, jotting down my feelings with teary eyes. VIT has been more than a home to me. The first few months were the hardest for me, it was hard to communicate with my peers. It took a real toll to get used to the food. Even now you give me ten chances and I’m sure I can’t spell the names of many dishes in the mess.
As a semester passed I grew closer to people, I made a few friends whom I know would be with me for life. VIT has always been my survival support system. The faculty and management are very approachable and have helped me in everything, may it be hostel room or the classes the care is the same. Living up to the motto VIT has truly groomed me to be a professional. VIT sure has provided me with a "place to learn, a chance to grow".
HU XIAOYU

VIT has offered me a lot of opportunities to develop my career and personal skills. The university has offered me a platform to develop a specific field of interest regarding my career. It was also great that I got to study at the Hong Kong University of science and technology before coming here to complete my course. I’m really grateful to VIT for that.
Being here as also helped me improve my teamwork and leadership qualities. It also supported me in building my communication skills as I got an opportunity to work with different kinds of people from different countries. I’ve also had the opportunity to work with internships where I can gain relevant work experience in my field of interest.
I am proud to be a VITian!

B. TECH. ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING TANZANIA
My experience here at VIT University has been very beneficial so far. Relatively smaller class sizes enable direct student-instructor interactions for effective learning and the instructors are readily available after class hours to help clear any doubts. The university also boasts an excellent library with tons of books and e-resources spanning a plethora of subjects and fields of study, the RFID technology implemented there ensures that borrowing and returning books is a hassle-free process.
In addition to that, VIT University plays host to thousands of students from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds from all over India and other parts of the world. This has enabled me to develop personally by learning how to deal effectively with different kinds of people, which is important in a world where globalization is taking centre stage.

Coming to VIT was something I hadn't anticipated but ever since I’ve come here, the experience has been amazing. The past eighteen months have opened my eyes to a whole new world and my perspective on life has been broadened by my interaction with people from different backgrounds and cultures.
Outside of class, it's beneficial too. Being on both the football and athletics teams has enabled me to be in peak physical condition which also aids focus and helps in studies. It has also earned me a few free trips!
Most importantly, I've also made a lot of friends whom I'll never forget. It's an amazing experience and I'll just keep enjoying each day as it comes.

“I’m grateful to VIT for encouraging me to be myself.”
I’ve learnt a lot out here while working towards developing myself both personally and career-wise. I have felt deep concern for my wellbeing and special attention to my learning and education. This has helped me adapt fast to the school environment.
Teachers and classmates are friendly. Being here has taught me to communicate freely with students from different countries and this practice has laid a good foundation for the future. I am indeed proud to be studying here.

I dream that one-day l will build a University in my country and other countries and be a ray of hope not only to my country but the whole world as well. I still believe education is power and hope to be a part of the movement towards it.
When anyone chooses an educational institution, the first thing that comes to the mind is academics. You may also dream of being in extra-curricular activities and possibly becoming a star in what you are good at, but those are secondary. I too dreamt of all this when l came to VIT University, I didn’t, however, expect to both live my dreams and grow in the process. Though this isn’t the typical ‘university life’ that everyone expects, my time in VIT has definitely been exceptional.
At first, l felt overwhelmed - adjusting to the new environment, away from home, culture, food - you name it! But once I accepted the fact that this was my life for the next 3 years I started noticing the ocean of opportunities around me. Making a lot of good friends, participating in great clubs, playing the sports l love most and of course balancing it all with my academics became my aim. I joined the basketball team and also became of the club M. A. D. (Make a difference)
I can now go out there and pursue any career of my choice knowing l can do it. It is a feeling l would not want to forget. Now l walk around the campus with a broad smile knowing l have an unending story to tell about my University life. If l were to choose all over again the Universities l would want to go, VIT will be first on my list.
I didn’t just learn and grow. I had the time of my life.

VIT has helped me learn how to express myself and have the confidence to speak about what I think is right. I see a big difference from my first year and now. It has made me a better person and reminded me that college is not only about studies but growing in other areas such as our social life, interacting with people from different places, improving my talents by participating in various competitions, a chance to know other people's ideas as well and learning from them. Living together as one community is hard mostly because there are cultural differences and a barrier in language but despite all this, we love each other and help one another as a family.
VIT is home despite not having our parents and relatives at this place; we have guardians to help us and be there for us such as our proctors, programme chairs, faculty and most of all the international relations office.

Being a part of VIT University opened up a world of opportunities and possibilities for me. I have met so many beautiful and loving people from different parts of the world who have made VIT a home away from home and also taught me so much about different aspects of life. I also learnt so much from my devoted teachers and through seminars. The brilliance of different functions held like graVITas and Rivera also inspired me to be creative and to be the best I can be. I have been blessed to be a part of this institution and I believe it has moulded me into a better individual.
NETRA B. GHALLEY
B.TECH CIVIL ENGINEERING BHUTAN
My experience in VIT has been amazing. VIT is not only a learning institute but also a home away from home for me. I expected that as a foreigner, who probably wasn't very equipped with the ways of the outside world, I would struggle to adjust in this new environment. However, with the support that I got from the university, I was comfortable within a short span of time.
The University is home to students from all over the world. And this has helped me gain a broader perspective on people and an understanding of diverse cultures and backgrounds. It is here that I have learnt to recognize my true potential and focus on its development.
I am also a part of Student Club known as Youth Red Cross (NGO) where I get to help underprivileged and vulnerable sections of the society. This service has helped me see the world with a different perspective. VIT has given me a lot to grow as an individual and I hope it continues to do so.
PEARL A. HAZEL
B.SC. MULTIMEDIA AND ANIMATION RWANDA
I've always loved to draw and work with my hands and that is why I leapt at the opportunity to join the Bachelor's program in Multimedia and Animation here; not only did I get a degree in animation, but also in Multimedia which is very important in gaining a wider scope in the entertainment field. Like a tree, my course is filled with so many branches that one is literally spoiled for choice when it comes down to selecting a major. The Professors are so helpful because they are patient and also their passion for the field fuels us, students, to want to give our best.
Education aside, VIT has also opened up the world to me. The different cultures here, from all over the world, make my understanding of life better because I am able to adjust my mind to different situations. I leave for my home country Uganda this year after three wonderful years but I will always remember India, more specifically, VIT as a home away from home.
Thank you VIT for this amazing experience!
RAHUL NAGARKOTI

Studying away from home is always a difficult decision to make. Studying in another country, all the more. However, my experience in VIT has helped me grow from strength to strength both as a person and as a student. I try to make the best of the variety of facilities provided by the University that allow me to pursue my extra-curricular interests in tandem with my academic. Something I’ve done since my school days.
I dedicate most of my free time to my favourite sport and representing the University football team is an experience I have always relished. Meeting new people, I learn new things each day and have found some great friends who complete the picture of ‘University Life’ I had in mind when I arrived here.
A place to learn, a chance to grow indeed!
TASHI GYELTSHEN
Truly a place to learn and grow. Incorporating all the modern needs of students with a sea of opportunities, VIT has nurtured my sense of responsibility and confidence. The faculty is ever ready to help me with studies and personal challenges.
VIT has offered me more than what a student would desire for as his educational accomplishment. I am truly grateful to be part of this outstanding university.
WANG XIAOLONG
B.SC. COMPUTER SCIENCE CHINA
The time I spent in VIT will be the deepest memory of my life. It is here that I have received the greatest opportunity to develop my career and personality.
This is the first time studied abroad. When I come here, however, everything was different and I was worried that my English wouldn’t be good enough to keep up with the pace. The university, however, is really beautiful and the teachers are really kind and patient. My time in VIT has helped me improve both my subject expertise as well as my fluency in English. I’ve gained so much from this university that I’ve decided to stay back and pursue my Masters here as well!
WANG SHENGYU
In China, VIT is a much-known university. A lot of other people I know are proud to have graduated from here. For us international students, we face obvious obstacles and constraints such as language, self-reliance, as well as difficulty in performance and results. However, this being an inclusive school, has a variety of teaching and other support staff, who help make it easier for students to work hard and achieve good results. The students and faculty here are very friendly, happy to help and care about our welfare. It's a matter of pride for me to graduate from VIT University.
WU DAN
Studying here, in India, has helped me improve my English ability. I have made many new friends and had diverse experiences. With the rich culture of this country and exciting campus amenities; suffice it to say that my college life has indeed been colourful.
At VIT, I’m not merely gaining subject expertise, I’m getting the first real taste of independence in life and this has been bittersweet. Living far away from your family on your own, I have learned to handle the ups and downs of life independently. While giving me an opportunity to converse with and learn from experts, I’m usually busy with plenty of assignments and projects that I’m sure will take me down the road to a great career. The university has laid a solid foundation for my future.

'With an eco-system extremely ideal for learning, VIT as an institution lives up to its mantra. She empowers her faculty and student body with the resources required to conduct innovative researches based on knowledge gained in her four walls, with a focus on tackling challenges that the human race face.
My journey in VIT has been a magnificent one so far considering her impact on my career, I have presented a platform where I could undertake diverse professional training on Cisco Systems to Microsoft in the labs existing on the Campus.
Rivera and Gravitas are events that are much awaited for as it brings a chance to witness the cultural diversities existing in the campus. So far, I would be glad to undertake another program here if the opportunity appeared.
THAYALAN GANESHAN
M.TECH. ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, MAURITIUS
Leaving your country and your family to go abroad is always a big and difficult decision. The initial apprehension about whether that decision is right or wrong still lingers. I am happy to say that those fears are easily overcome once you step into VIT.
The work culture is different as people from diverse cultural backgrounds mingle and work together towards the same goal. Student participation in the various community programs makes it all the more interesting.
The University mentors you as well to face the world as not a single day goes by without the conduction of a workshop or training program. I have had the pleasure of participating in debates, the water conservation week as well as the various cultural festivals organized. Each of these experiences has been quite enjoyable and I am looking forward to others
LONG YI
M.SC. COMPUTER SCIENCE, CHINA
The first year I come to VIT, everything was strange for me - the culture, the language and campus life. My Indian classmates were friendly and spoke slowly, and explained the meaning of words and many things unique here. My classmates also helped me out with notes and copies for review. Faculty have been supportive, given that I’m a foreign student. One thing that VIT has taught me is to be independent - If you want to get something done, just roll up your sleeves and do it. The University will not tell you the solutions of problems but will show you the way to solve it.
After completing my B.Sc. Computer Science here, I have moved on to continue with my Masters. What can I say - Once a VITian, always a VITian.
TEK KADAYAT
M.TECH. BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, NEPAL
It’s been a great pleasure to be the part of the esteemed Institution which has been imparting quality education for over 3 decades.
I was searching for a star but I found a galaxy when I came to VIT. The abundance of academic resources and great lecturers has played a great role in my academic and skill development and growth. I have been able to actually look at the world from a different perspective.
I will always value the time I've spent in VIT with a wide mix of cultures and ethnicities.
TOSHEN M. THOMAS
MASTER OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS (MCA), U.S.A.
Ever since I began my life at VIT, I felt like I have entered into a Nano world. Modern, innovative and student friendly campus with sophisticated computer labs will make the better of anyone who opts for their studies here. If 'Sky is the limit', here in VIT, there is no limit as to what one is to become. Various add-on courses, friendly staff and professors all help to make the life at VIT a wonderful experience. The flexible time table helps one to add additional course certificates under one’s belt. It is also important to know various cultures of the world, and the International student community at VIT offers an opportunity to do so.
